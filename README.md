# We Use the fashion_mnist dataset to make predictions on the type of clothing based on an image.

About the Data: Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

I have used basic neural networks to predict the type of clothing from the image and achieved an accuracy of about 90%
